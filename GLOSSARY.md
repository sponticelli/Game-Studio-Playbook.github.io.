# Glossary of Terms

*A comprehensive reference of game industry terminology, metrics, and concepts used throughout this workbook.*

---

## A

**A/B Testing**
A method of comparing two versions of a game feature, UI element, or system by showing variant A to some players and variant B to others, then measuring which performs better against predefined metrics.

**Accountable (RACI)**
In a RACI matrix, the person who is ultimately answerable for the correct completion of a deliverable or task and has yes/no/veto power. There should be exactly one A per task.

**Ad Mediation**
Software that manages multiple ad networks, optimizing which ads to show to maximize revenue while maintaining player experience.

**Alpha**
A development milestone where all planned features are implemented and functional, though content may be incomplete and bugs are expected. The game is playable from start to finish.

**Analytics SDK**
Software Development Kit that tracks player behavior, events, and metrics within a game, sending data to analytics platforms for analysis.

**ARPDAU (Average Revenue Per Daily Active User)**
Total revenue divided by Daily Active Users. Key metric for understanding revenue generation across the entire player base.
`ARPDAU = Total Revenue / DAU`

**ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)**
Total revenue divided by the number of paying users. Indicates how much paying players spend on average.
`ARPPU = Total Revenue / Paying Users`

**ASO (App Store Optimization)**
The process of improving an app's visibility in app store search results and top charts through keyword optimization, visual assets, and ratings management.

**Asset**
Any game content file including art, audio, animations, levels, or data. Can be 2D, 3D, procedural, or data-driven.

---

## B

**Backend**
Server-side systems that handle data storage, player accounts, matchmaking, leaderboards, and other services requiring persistent data or multiplayer functionality.

**Backlog**
A prioritized list of features, bugs, and tasks waiting to be worked on. Typically managed in project management tools like Jira, Linear, or Trello.

**Battle Pass**
A monetization system offering tiered rewards (free and premium tracks) that players unlock through gameplay over a limited time period, typically a season.

**Benchmark**
Industry-standard metrics used for comparison. For example, D1 retention benchmarks vary by genre: casual (40%+), mid-core (35%+), hardcore (30%+).

**Beta**
A development milestone where all content is complete, features are frozen, and the focus is on polish, bug fixing, and optimization. The game is feature-complete.

**Bottleneck**
A constraint in a system that limits overall throughput. In content production, this is typically a role or process stage that limits how fast content can be created.

**Buffer**
Additional time built into schedules to account for uncertainty, variance, and unexpected issues. Not the same as padding or waste.

**Build**
A compiled, executable version of the game. Builds can be debug (for development), release (for distribution), or specific configurations for testing.

**Burn Rate**
The rate at which a project or company spends money, typically measured monthly. Critical for runway calculations.
`Burn Rate = Monthly Expenses`

**Bus Factor**
The number of team members who would need to be unavailable (hit by a bus) before the project is in serious trouble due to knowledge loss. Lower is riskier.

---

## C

**CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**
The total cost of acquiring a single player, including marketing, UA campaigns, and associated overhead.
`CAC = Marketing Spend / New Players Acquired`

**Certification**
The approval process required by platform holders (Apple, Google, Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo) before a game can be released or updated on their platform.

**Churn**

`Churn Rate = (Players Lost / Players at Start) × 100`

**CMS (Content Management System)**
Tools or platforms that allow non-technical team members to create, edit, and manage game content without code changes.

**Cohort**

`Example: "January 2024 cohort" = all players who installed in January 2024`

**Consulted (RACI)**

**Consumable**
An in-game item that is used up when activated and can be purchased repeatedly (currency, boosters, continues).

**Conversion Rate**
The percentage of players who complete a desired action, most commonly making their first purchase.
`Conversion Rate = (Paying Players / Total Players) × 100`

**Core Loop**
The primary gameplay cycle players engage with repeatedly. Typically measured in seconds to minutes.
`Example: Aim → Shoot → Collect → Upgrade → Repeat`

**CPI (Cost Per Install)**
The average cost to acquire one game installation through paid user acquisition.
`CPI = UA Spend / Installs`
