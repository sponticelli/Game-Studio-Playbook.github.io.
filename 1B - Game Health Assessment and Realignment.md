# Game Health Assessment & Realignment

## For Mature Games & Live Operations

> *"Successful liveOps is only possible when the core gameplay has good retention by itself. It is not a support cost—it is almost a full development team with ongoing traffic acquisition."*

---

## When to Use This Block

Use Track B (this block) instead of Track A if:

- [ ] Your game has been live for 1+ years
- [ ] You have meaningful historical data to analyze
- [ ] The team inherited the project or has significant turnover
- [ ] You're questioning whether current direction is right
- [ ] Maintenance burden is crowding out new development
- [ ] Metrics are declining or plateauing
- [ ] You're considering a major update, pivot, or sunset

**This block is an audit and realignment exercise.** Complete it before planning your next major initiative.

---

## How to Use This Block

**Recommended cadence:** Complete this audit quarterly for live games, or whenever considering major strategic shifts.

# 1B.1 Vision Drift Assessment

## Why It Matters

Games evolve. Over years, countless features, events, and pivots accumulate. The game players experience today may bear little resemblance to the original vision—sometimes for better, sometimes for worse. Understanding where you've drifted helps you decide: return to the original vision, embrace the evolution, or consciously chart a new direction.

## Framework: Vision Archaeology

### Step 1: Reconstruct the Original Vision

*What was this game supposed to be when it launched?*

| Element | Original Vision (Launch) | Source |
|---------|-------------------------|--------|
| Core fantasy | | GDD, marketing, interviews |
| Target player | | Launch materials |
| Core loop | | Original design docs |
| Key differentiators | | Press releases, reviews |
| Business model intent | | Internal docs |

### Step 2: Document Current Reality

*What is the game actually doing now?*

| Element | Current Reality | Evidence |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| Core fantasy delivered | | Player feedback, reviews |
| Who actually plays | | Analytics, demographics |
| What players actually do | | Session data, feature usage |
| What differentiates now | | Competitive analysis |
| How it actually monetizes | | Revenue breakdown |

### Step 3: Identify Drift

| Area | Drift Direction | Intentional? | Positive/Negative? |
|------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| | | Yes / No / Unknown | + / - / Neutral |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

## Framework: Vision Drift Quadrant

```
                    Intentional Drift
                          │
           EVOLVED        │        PIVOTED
        (Planned growth)  │    (Strategic shift)
                          │
    ──────────────────────┼──────────────────────
                          │
          DECAYED         │         LOST
      (Quality erosion)   │    (Unplanned drift)
                          │
                   Unintentional Drift
```

**Our game is in quadrant:** _______________

**This means we should:** _______________

## Diagnostic Questions

| Question | Answer | Implication |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Can new team members articulate what the game is about? | | If no: vision unclear |
| Do veteran players describe the game the way you would? | | If no: perception gap |
| Does the tutorial still reflect the core experience? | | If no: onboarding mismatch |
| Would the original creators recognize this game? | | Drift indicator |
| Are recent features coherent with each other? | | If no: fragmentation |

## Vision Decision Framework

Based on your drift assessment, choose a direction:

| Option | When to Choose | Actions Required |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Return to roots** | Drift was unintentional, original vision still relevant, players miss "old game" | Audit features against original pillars, sunset additions that don't fit |
| **Embrace evolution** | Game has naturally found a better identity, players prefer current state | Document new vision, align future work to evolved identity |
| **Conscious pivot** | Market has shifted, original vision no longer viable, new opportunity identified | Full vision rewrite, major update marketing, may lose some existing players |
| **Maintain course** | Drift is minimal, current direction is working | Document current vision explicitly, use for alignment |

**Our decision:** _______________

## Checklist

- [ ] Original vision documents located and reviewed
- [ ] Current state documented with evidence
- [ ] Drift areas identified and categorized
- [ ] Quadrant placement determined
- [ ] Direction decision made
- [ ] New/updated vision statement drafted (if needed)

| CPI (blended) | | | | ↑↓→ |
| CPI (by channel) | | | | ↑↓→ |
| ROAS D7 | | | | ↑↓→ |
| ROAS D30 | | | | ↑↓→ |

**Acquisition diagnosis:**
```
_______________________________________________________________________________
```

## Framework: Cohort Quality Comparison

Compare cohort behavior over time—are new users better or worse than old ones?

| Cohort | D1 Ret | D7 Ret | D30 Ret | D7 ARPU | Payer Conv |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|---------|------------|
| 2 years ago | | | | | |
| 1 year ago | | | | | |
| 6 months ago | | | | | |
| 3 months ago | | | | | |
| Last month | | | | | |

**Cohort quality trend:** Improving / Stable / Declining

**Hypothesis for trend:**
```
_______________________________________________________________________________
```

## Framework: Red Flag Identification

| Red Flag | Threshold | Your Status | Action Required |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| D1 retention declining | >5% drop YoY | | FTUE audit |
| DAU/MAU below 20% | <0.20 | | Engagement audit |
| Whale concentration >50% | >50% revenue from <1% users | | Revenue diversification |
| Organic % below 20% | <20% | | ASO, virality audit |
| LTV < CPI | Negative unit economics | | Monetization or UA overhaul |
| Payer conversion declining | >20% drop YoY | | Economy audit |
| Session length declining | >15% drop YoY | | Content/engagement audit |

## Diagnostic Questions

| Question | Answer | Implication |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Are we comparing to relevant benchmarks (genre, age)? | | Old games have different benchmarks |
| Do we understand WHY metrics are moving? | | Correlation ≠ causation |
| Are we tracking the right things? | | Missing metrics = blind spots |
| How reliable is our data? | | Bad data = bad decisions |
| What would "good" look like for a game our age? | | Expectations must be realistic |

## Checklist

- [ ] All core metrics pulled for 12+ month trend
- [ ] Cohort comparison completed
- [ ] Benchmarks identified for game age and genre

# 1B.4 Feature Usage Audit

## Why It Matters

Mature games accumulate features like houses accumulate stuff. Each feature has ongoing costs: bug fixes, balance updates, QA coverage, localization, documentation, new player confusion. Features that few players use drain capacity from improvements that would matter more. Regular audits identify what to invest in, what to simplify, and what to sunset.

## Framework: Feature Inventory

List all major features and systems in your game:

| # | Feature/System | Launch Feature? | Last Major Update | Owner |
|---|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| 1 | | Yes / No | | |
| 2 | | Yes / No | | |
| 3 | | Yes / No | | |
| 4 | | Yes / No | | |
| 5 | | Yes / No | | |
| 6 | | Yes / No | | |
| 7 | | Yes / No | | |
| 8 | | Yes / No | | |
| 9 | | Yes / No | | |
| 10 | | Yes / No | | |
| 11 | | Yes / No | | |
| 12 | | Yes / No | | |
| 13 | | Yes / No | | |
| 14 | | Yes / No | | |
| 15 | | Yes / No | | |

## Framework: Feature Health Matrix

For each feature, assess:

| Feature | DAU % Using | Revenue Impact | Maint. Cost | Strategic Value | Health Score |
|---------|-------------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | Core/Support/Legacy | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |

**Health Score Calculation:**
- Usage: High=3, Med=2, Low=1
- Revenue: High=3, Med=2, Low=1
- Maintenance: High=1, Med=2, Low=3 (inverted—low cost is good)
- Strategic: Core=3, Support=2, Legacy=1
- **Total: /12**

## Framework: Feature Quadrant Analysis

```
                     High Usage
                         │
        CORE            │           OPTIMIZE
   (Protect & enhance)   │    (High value, high cost—
                         │     simplify or invest)
                         │
    ─────────────────────┼─────────────────────
                         │
        REVIEW           │           SUNSET
   (Low usage but may    │    (Low value, any cost—
    have strategic value)│     remove or archive)
                         │
                     Low Usage

    ◄─── Low Maintenance Cost ───────── High Maintenance Cost ───►
```

### Feature Placement

| Quadrant | Features | Recommended Action |
|----------|----------|--------------------|
| **CORE** | | Protect, enhance, never break |
| **OPTIMIZE** | | Reduce maintenance cost or increase value |
| **REVIEW** | | Investigate—is low usage a discovery problem or disinterest? |
| **SUNSET** | | Remove, archive, or stop maintaining |

## Framework: Feature Dependency Mapping

Before sunsetting, understand dependencies:

| Sunset Candidate | Depends On | Depended On By | Removal Complexity |
|------------------|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| | | | Low / Medium / High |
| | | | |
| | | | |

## Framework: Maintenance Cost Estimation

| Feature | Eng Hours/Month | QA Hours/Month | CS Tickets/Month | Total Monthly Cost |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| **Total** | | | | |

**% of capacity spent on maintenance:** _______________

## Diagnostic Questions

| Question | Answer | Implication |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| What % of features are used by <10% of DAU? | | Bloat indicator |
| What % of capacity goes to maintaining vs. building? | | Velocity indicator |
| When did we last remove a feature? | | Culture indicator |
| Do new players use the same features as veterans? | | Complexity/discovery issue |
| Which features generate the most bugs? | | Technical debt indicator |

## Checklist

- [ ] Complete feature inventory created
- [ ] Usage data pulled for each feature
- [ ] Revenue attribution estimated
- [ ] Maintenance cost estimated
- [ ] Features placed in quadrants
- [ ] Sunset candidates identified

# 1B.5 Technical Debt Inventory

## Why It Matters

Technical debt compounds. Systems built quickly 5 years ago become bottlenecks today. Code that "works" may be fragile, slow, or incomprehensible to current team members. Mature games must actively manage tech debt or drown in it—every new feature becomes harder, every bug fix risks breaking something else.

## Framework: Technical Debt Categories

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Code Debt** | Poor architecture, duplication, no tests | Spaghetti code, copy-paste, missing unit tests |
| **Infrastructure Debt** | Outdated systems, scaling issues | Old server tech, manual deployments, no monitoring |
| **Tool Debt** | Inefficient pipelines, manual processes | No content tools, slow builds, manual config |
| **Documentation Debt** | Missing or outdated docs | No onboarding docs, stale wikis |
| **Dependency Debt** | Outdated SDKs, deprecated APIs | Old Unity version, sunset ad networks |

## Framework: Technical Debt Inventory

| System/Area | Debt Type | Severity | Impact | Remediation Effort | Priority |
|-------------|-----------|----------|--------|-------------------|----------|
| | | Crit/High/Med/Low | | S/M/L/XL | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |

**Severity Definitions:**
- **Critical:** Actively causing incidents, blocking features, or security risk
- **High:** Significantly slowing development, reliability risk
- **Medium:** Annoying, adds friction, but workable
- **Low:** Suboptimal but not impacting day-to-day

## Framework: Debt Impact Assessment

| Debt Item | Blocks New Features? | Causes Bugs? | Slows Velocity? | Security Risk? | Player-Facing? |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |

## Framework: Debt Paydown Prioritization

**Prioritization Matrix:**

```
                     High Impact
                         │
        CRITICAL         │        SCHEDULED
   (Pay down NOW—        │    (Plan for next
    blocking progress)   │     major release)
                         │
    ─────────────────────┼─────────────────────
                         │
        OPPORTUNISTIC    │        TOLERATE
   (Fix when touching    │    (Accept the cost,
    related code)        │     don't prioritize)
                         │
                     Low Impact

    ◄─── Low Effort ────────────────────── High Effort ───►
```

| Quadrant | Items | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **CRITICAL** | | Immediate sprint allocation |
| **SCHEDULED** | | Roadmap for dedicated paydown |
| **OPPORTUNISTIC** | | Boy Scout rule—leave better than found |
| **TOLERATE** | | Document and accept |

## Framework: Debt Budget

What % of capacity will you allocate to debt paydown?

| Approach | % of Capacity | When to Use |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Crisis mode | 50%+ | Debt actively blocking work |
| Active paydown | 20-30% | High debt, need to improve velocity |
| Maintenance mode | 10-20% | Manageable debt, steady improvement |
| Minimal | <10% | Low debt or accepting decline |

**Our current allocation:** _______________% 

**Our target allocation:** _______________%

## Framework: SDK & Dependency Audit

| Dependency | Current Version | Latest Version | EOL/Deprecated? | Update Urgency |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Game Engine | | | | |
| Analytics SDK | | | | |
| Ad SDK | | | | |
| IAP SDK | | | | |
| Push SDK | | | | |
| Backend/Server | | | | |
| | | | | |

## Diagnostic Questions

| Question | Answer | Implication |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| How long does it take a new engineer to be productive? | | Onboarding friction = debt |
| What's the average age of our dependencies? | | Update risk |
| How often do "simple" changes cause unexpected bugs? | | Architecture debt |
| What areas does no one want to touch? | | Fear = debt |
| How much of the codebase has test coverage? | | Safety net gap |

## Checklist

- [ ] All major systems assessed for debt
- [ ] Debt categorized by type
- [ ] Severity and impact rated
- [ ] Debt placed in priority quadrants
- [ ] Capacity allocation decided
- [ ] SDK/dependency audit completed
- [ ] Debt paydown roadmap drafted

# 1B.7 Economy Health Check

## Why It Matters

Game economies are living systems. Over years, inflation creeps in, sinks become inadequate, early-game tuning clashes with late-game reality, and monetization friction points shift. An unhealthy economy drives away new players, frustrates veterans, and leaves money on the table. Regular health checks prevent slow decay.

## Framework: Currency Flow Analysis

# 1B.10 Institutional Knowledge Audit

## Why It Matters

Over 8 years, knowledge accumulates in people's heads, not documents. Original developers leave. Decisions made years ago affect code today with no record of why. Critical systems are understood by one person. When institutional knowledge is lost, teams repeat mistakes, break things, and waste time rediscovering what was already known.

## Framework: Knowledge Risk Assessment

### Critical Systems Knowledge Map

| System/Area | Primary Expert | Backup Expert | Documentation Level | Bus Factor Risk |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| | | | None/Partial/Good | High/Med/Low |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

**Bus Factor:** How many people would need to leave before critical knowledge is lost?

| Risk Level | Criteria | Systems in This Category |
|------------|----------|-------------------------|
| Critical | 1 person knows, no docs | |
| High | 1-2 people know, partial docs | |
| Medium | 2+ people know, good docs | |
| Low | Team-wide knowledge, excellent docs | |

## Framework: Documentation Inventory

| Document Type | Exists? | Current? | Accessible? | Quality |
|---------------|---------|----------|-------------|---------|
| Architecture overview | | | | |
| System design docs | | | | |
| API documentation | | | | |
| Economy design doc | | | | |
| Content guidelines | | | | |
| Onboarding guide | | | | |
| Runbooks (incidents) | | | | |
| Decision log | | | | |
| Historical context docs | | | | |

## Framework: Knowledge Preservation Priority

| Knowledge Area | Criticality | Current State | Priority | Action |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|----------|--------|
| | High/Med/Low | At risk/Okay | 1-5 | Document/Train/Record |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

## Framework: "Why We Did It This Way" Archaeology

For mature games, understanding historical decisions is crucial. Create a living document:

| System/Decision | What | When | Why | Who Decided | Still Valid? |
|-----------------|------|------|-----|-------------|--------------|
| | | | | | Yes/No/Unknown |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |

## Framework: Knowledge Transfer Plan

### For At-Risk Knowledge

| Knowledge Area | Current Expert | Target Learners | Method | Timeline |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|--------|----------|
| | | | Pair work/Doc/Video | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

# 1B.11 Sunset Candidates List

## Why It Matters

Adding is easier than removing. But every feature, system, and content type carries ongoing cost. Mature games must actively prune to stay healthy—freeing capacity, reducing complexity, and focusing on what matters. Identifying sunset candidates is the first step; executing sunsets requires planning.

## Framework: Sunset Candidate Identification

Consolidate candidates from previous audits:

### From Feature Usage Audit (1B.4)

| Feature | Usage | Maintenance Cost | Sunset Rationale |
|---------|-------|------------------|------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

# 1B.12 Improvement Prioritization Framework

## Why It Matters

Mature games have infinite improvement opportunities and finite capacity. Without a rigorous prioritization framework, teams chase shiny objects, defer hard problems, and fail to move the metrics that matter. A structured approach ensures effort goes where it creates most value.

## Framework: Opportunity Inventory

Consolidate improvement opportunities from all audits:

| # | Opportunity | Source | Category | Effort | Impact Hypothesis |
|---|-------------|--------|----------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | | 1B.__ | Feature/Tech/Content/Economy/Process | S/M/L/XL | |
| 2 | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | |
| 5 | | | | | |
| 6 | | | | | |
| 7 | | | | | |
| 8 | | | | | |
| 9 | | | | | |
| 10 | | | | | |

## Framework: ICE Scoring

**I**mpact × **C**onfidence × **E**ase = ICE Score

| Opportunity | Impact (1-10) | Confidence (1-10) | Ease (1-10) | ICE Score | Rank |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|------|
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |

**Scoring Guide:**

| Dimension | 1-3 | 4-6 | 7-10 |
|-----------|-----|-----|------|
| **Impact** | Minimal metric movement | Moderate improvement | Significant KPI improvement |
| **Confidence** | Guess/hope | Some data/precedent | Strong data/proven |
| **Ease** | XL effort, high risk | Medium effort, manageable | Quick win, low risk |

## Framework: RICE Scoring (Alternative)

**R**each × **I**mpact × **C**onfidence / **E**ffort = RICE Score

| Opportunity | Reach (users/month) | Impact (0.25-3) | Confidence (%) | Effort (person-months) | RICE Score |
|-------------|--------------------| ----------------|----------------|----------------------|------------|
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |

**Impact Scale:**
- 3 = Massive (changes behavior significantly)
- 2 = High (notable improvement)
- 1 = Medium (some improvement)
- 0.5 = Low (minimal improvement)
- 0.25 = Minimal (barely noticeable)

## Framework: Prioritization Dimensions

Beyond ICE/RICE, consider strategic fit:

| Opportunity | Metric Impact | Strategic Alignment | Risk Level | Dependencies | Final Priority |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|------------|--------------|----------------|
| | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | None/Some/Many | 1-5 |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |

## Framework: Priority Buckets

Sort opportunities into action categories:

| Bucket | Criteria | Opportunities | Action |
|--------|----------|---------------|--------|
| **Do Now** | High ICE, low risk, aligns with strategy | | Next sprint/cycle |
| **Plan** | High value but needs preparation | | Roadmap for next quarter |
| **Investigate** | High potential but low confidence | | Run experiment/research |
| **Backlog** | Moderate value, not urgent | | Keep visible, revisit |
| **Reject** | Low value or doesn't align | | Document why and close |

## Framework: Sequencing Considerations

| Consideration | Question | Impact on Sequence |
|---------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Dependencies** | Does A need to happen before B? | Sequence accordingly |
| **Learning** | Will this experiment inform other decisions? | Do earlier |
| **Seasonality** | Is there a time-sensitive window? | Schedule around events |
| **Team availability** | Who's needed and when are they free? | Resource-constrained |
| **Risk bundling** | Too many risky things at once? | Spread risk |

## Framework: Quarterly Roadmap Template

| Priority | Initiative | Goal/Hypothesis | Effort | Success Metric | Owner |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|--------|----------------|-------|
| 1 | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | |
| 5 | | | | | |

**Total planned effort:** _______________ 

**Remaining capacity for unplanned:** _______________

## Diagnostic Questions

| Question | Answer | Implication |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| How do we currently prioritize? | | Process maturity |
| Do we have data to inform impact estimates? | | Confidence level |
| How often do priorities shift mid-quarter? | | Planning stability |
| Are we working on highest-value items? | | Alignment check |
| What's languishing in the backlog? | | Hidden important things |

## Checklist

- [ ] All improvement opportunities inventoried
- [ ] Scoring methodology chosen (ICE, RICE, or custom)
- [ ] All opportunities scored

## Framework: Decision Rights Clarity

For mature games, decision rights often become unclear. Re-establish:

| Decision Type | Who Decides | Who Consults | Who's Informed |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Major feature adds | | | |
| Feature sunset | | | |
| Economy changes | | | |
| Event calendar | | | |
| Technical investments | | | |
| Team changes | | | |
| Budget allocation | | | |
| Kill/sunset game | | | |

## Framework: Scenario Alignment

Test alignment with hypothetical scenarios:

| Scenario | Stakeholder A Response | Stakeholder B Response | Aligned? |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|----------|
| Metrics decline 20%—cut costs or invest to fix? | | | |
| Competitor launches—copy features or differentiate? | | | |
| Major tech debt—delay features to fix? | | | |
| Team burnout risk—reduce output or add people? | | | |
| Revenue short of target—more aggressive monetization? | | | |

## Framework: Realignment Commitments

After discussion, document explicit agreements:

| Topic | Agreement | Stakeholders Committed |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|
| Primary goal for next 6 months | | |
| Acceptable metric ranges | | |
| Investment vs. harvest stance | | |
| Team sustainability commitment | | |
| Decision-making process | | |

# 1B.14 Realignment Workshop

## Why It Matters

The Block 1B audit surfaces reality. The realignment workshop creates shared commitment to act on it. Without this explicit moment of alignment, insights get filed and forgotten, and the team continues as before. This workshop is the bridge between diagnosis and action.

## Framework: Workshop Agenda

**Duration:** 3-4 hours (or split across sessions)

**Participants:** All key stakeholders identified in 1B.13

| Time | Activity | Output |
|------|----------|--------|
| 15 min | Context: Why are we here? What's at stake? | Shared urgency |
| 30 min | Current Reality: Present audit findings | Shared understanding |
| 20 min | Q&A and Clarification | Address misunderstandings |
| 30 min | Vision check: Is our direction still right? | Vision confirmed or updated |
| 30 min | Priority discussion: What matters most now? | Aligned priorities |
| 30 min | Capacity reality: What can we actually do? | Realistic expectations |
| 20 min | Decisions: What are we committing to? | Explicit commitments |
| 15 min | Next steps: Who does what by when? | Action plan |

## Framework: Pre-Workshop Preparation

### Pre-Workshop Questions to Seed

Send to participants 48+ hours before:

1. What's the single biggest threat to this game's future?
2. What's the biggest opportunity we're not pursuing?
3. If we could only do ONE thing next quarter, what should it be?
4. What are we doing that we should stop?

## Framework: Discussion Guide

### Section 1: Current Reality Acceptance

**Questions to drive discussion:**
- Does this data match your intuition? Where are you surprised?
- What are we not measuring that we should be?

### Section 2: Direction Validation

**Questions to drive discussion:**
- Given what we now know, is our current direction right?
- Should we continue, evolve, or pivot?
- What would success look like in 12 months?

**Success criteria:** Explicit decision on strategic direction

### Section 3: Priority Alignment

**Questions to drive discussion:**
- Of all the improvements identified, which 3 matter most?
- What are we willing to NOT do to focus?
- What are we willing to sunset or deprioritize?

**Success criteria:** Ranked priorities with stakeholder buy-in

### Section 4: Commitment

**Questions to drive discussion:**
- What specifically are we committing to deliver?
- What resources will we allocate?
- How will we measure success?
- What will we stop doing to make room?
