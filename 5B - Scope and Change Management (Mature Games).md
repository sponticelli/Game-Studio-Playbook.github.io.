# Scope & Change Management (Mature Games)

This track focuses on managing scope and change in running live operations where the game is already launched and generating revenue.

# 5B.1 Live Ops Scope Creep Audit

## Why It Matters

In live games, scope creep happens in small increments across every event, every content drop, every sale. The monthly event that used to take 2 days now takes 5. The "standard" offer template has 15 variations. The content pipeline runs at 110% capacity as the new normal. Auditing your current state reveals how far you've drifted from sustainable operations.

## Framework: Complexity Trend Analysis

### Event Complexity Over Time

| Event | Date | Prep Days | Team Hours | Assets | Config Lines | Post-Launch Bugs | Notes |
|-------|------|-----------|------------|--------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| | | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | | |

**6-month trend:** ⬆️ Increasing / ➡️ Stable / ⬇️ Decreasing

**Complexity increase:** ___%

### Content Volume Over Time

| Month | Content Drops | Total Assets | Team Capacity % | Crunch Days |
|-------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

**Trend:** ⬆️ Increasing / ➡️ Stable / ⬇️ Decreasing

## Framework: Drift From Baseline

| Metric | Original Target | Current Reality | Drift |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Events per month | | | |
| Prep time per event | | | |
| Assets per event | | | |
| Offer complexity | | | |
| Config changes per week | | | |
| Team overtime per month | | | |

**Total drift score:** _______________

## Diagnostic Questions

| Question | Answer | Implication |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| When did we last ship a "simple" event? | | Complexity normalized |
| What's our overtime frequency? | | Capacity mismatch |

# 5B.2 Feature Request Triage Optimization

## Why It Matters

Mature games accumulate feature requests from every direction—players, community, data, stakeholders, the team itself. Without aggressive triage, the backlog becomes a graveyard of good intentions that nobody reviews. Optimizing triage means faster decisions, clearer communication, and better resource allocation.

## Framework: Request Source Analysis

### Current Request Volume

| Source | Monthly Volume | Conversion to Action | Quality Signal |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Player feedback | | % | High/Med/Low |
| Community requests | | | |
| Data/analytics | | | |
| Stakeholder asks | | | |
| Team ideas | | | |
| Competitor reaction | | | |
| **TOTAL** | | | |

### Processing Capacity

| Metric | Current | Healthy Target |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Requests processed/week | | |
| Backlog size | | |
| Backlog age (oldest item) | | |
| Request → Decision time | | |

## Framework: Triage Efficiency Assessment

| Step | Time Spent | Value Add | Improvement |
|------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Intake/logging | | High/Med/Low | |
| Initial review | | | |
| Impact assessment | | | |
| Prioritization meeting | | | |
| Communication | | | |
| **TOTAL** | | | |

## Diagnostic Questions

| Question | Answer | Implication |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| How old is our oldest un-reviewed request? | | Backlog health |
| What percentage of requests become work? | | Signal vs. noise |
| How long until requesters get a response? | | Communication quality |
| Do we reject enough requests? | | Saying no skill |
| Are we processing requests faster than they arrive? | | Sustainable pace |

## Framework: Triage Criteria Refresh

Review and update your triage criteria:

| Criterion | Current Weight | Should Be | Change |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| Revenue impact | | | |
| Retention impact | | | |
| Pillar alignment | | | |
| Effort required | | | |
| Technical debt impact | | | |
| Community sentiment | | | |

## Framework: Auto-Triage Rules

Create rules to automatically route or reject:

| Condition | Auto-Action |
|-----------|-------------|
| Duplicate of existing request | Auto-merge |
| No pillar alignment | Auto-reject with template |
| >XL effort, no business case | Auto-park |
| Critical bug | Auto-escalate |
| From [source] + [criteria] | Auto-prioritize |

## Framework: Request Response Templates

**For rejection:**
> "Thanks for the suggestion. After review, we're not pursuing this because [reason]. We appreciate you taking the time to share your ideas."

**For parking:**
> "This is a good idea that aligns with our goals. We're not prioritizing it now because [reason], but it's in our backlog for future consideration."

**For acceptance:**
> "Great suggestion! We're adding this to our roadmap for [timeframe]. You'll see it in [version/update]."

## Checklist

- [ ] Request sources and volumes analyzed
- [ ] Triage efficiency assessed
- [ ] Criteria refreshed
- [ ] Auto-triage rules defined
- [ ] Response templates created
- [ ] Backlog health improved

## Tasks

1. **Analyze current request flow** — sources, volumes, outcomes
2. **Identify triage bottlenecks**
3. **Update triage criteria** for current game state
4. **Implement auto-triage** where possible
5. **Clear backlog** older than 90 days

# 5B.3 Change Impact Assessment — Live Game Edition

## Why It Matters

In a live game, every change touches real players with real money invested. A "minor" economy tweak can devalue purchases, invalidate strategies, and generate refund requests. Impact assessment for live games must include player impact, revenue risk, and sentiment risk alongside the technical and design considerations.

# 5B.4 Sustainable Content Velocity

## Why It Matters

Every live game finds a content velocity that balances player demand with team capacity. Too slow and players leave. Too fast and the team burns out or quality drops. Finding and maintaining sustainable velocity is the key to long-term live ops success.

## Framework: Current State Assessment

### Content Output Analysis

| Content Type | Monthly Output | Team Hours | Quality Rating | Sustainable? |
|--------------|---------------|------------|----------------|--------------|
| Events | | | 1-5 | Y/N |
| Content drops | | | | |
| Offers/sales | | | | |
| Bug fixes | | | | |
| Feature updates | | | | |
| **TOTAL** | | | | |

### Capacity Reality Check

| Metric | Current | Sustainable Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|-------------------|-----|
| Weekly team hours | | 40-45 | |
| Overtime hours/month | | <10 | |
| Weekend work frequency | | <1/month | |
| Vacation days taken | | >90% allocation | |
| Sick days trending | | Stable | |

# 5B.5 Update Scoping Discipline

## Why It Matters

Every game update is a scope management exercise. Without discipline, each update expands until it's late, rushed, or bloated. Update scoping discipline means knowing exactly what's in, what's out, and when to ship—then actually sticking to it.

## Framework: Update Types

| Type | Scope | Cadence | Risk Tolerance |
|------|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Hotfix** | Bug fixes only | As needed | Very low |
| **Patch** | Bugs + minor tuning | Bi-weekly | Low |
| **Minor Update** | Content + small features | Monthly | Medium |
| **Major Update** | New systems + content | Quarterly | Medium-high |
| **Expansion** | Major new content | 1-2/year | Higher |

## Framework: Update Scope Template

### Update: ________________ Target Date: _________

| Category | IN | OUT | Deferred To |
|----------|----|----|-------------|
| Bug fixes | | | |
| Balance changes | | | |
| New content | | | |
| Feature improvements | | | |
| New features | | | |
| Technical debt | | | |

**Total estimated effort:** _______________

**Buffer:** _______________%

**Lock date:** _______________

## Framework: Scope Lock Enforcement (Updates)

| Lock Stage | What's Frozen | Exceptions |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| T-2 weeks | Feature list | Critical only |
| T-1 week | Content | Critical bugs |
| T-3 days | All changes | Emergency only |
| T-1 day | Everything | Zero changes |

## Diagnostic Questions

| Question | Answer | Implication |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| How often do updates ship on time? | | Scoping accuracy |
| How often do we add scope mid-update? | | Discipline issue |
| What's our average scope creep per update? | | Predictability |
| Do we protect buffers or consume them? | | Risk management |

## Framework: Update Post-Mortem Questions

After each update, ask:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Did we ship what we planned? | |
| What was added after lock? | |
| What slipped to next update? | |
| Were estimates accurate? | |
| Where did we lose time? | |
| What will we do differently? | |

## Framework: Scope Negotiation Tactics

When stakeholders want to add scope:

| Tactic | Script |
|--------|--------|
| **Trade-off** | "We can add X if we remove Y" |
| **Defer** | "Great idea for next update" |
| **Scope down** | "What's the minimal version?" |
| **Data request** | "What data supports this priority?" |
| **Impact** | "Adding this means shipping [date] instead of [date]" |

## Checklist

- [ ] Update types defined with appropriate scope
- [ ] Scope template used for each update
- [ ] Lock dates enforced
- [ ] Post-mortems conducted
- [ ] Scope discipline tracked over time
- [ ] Team trained on negotiation tactics

## Tasks

1. **Define update types** for your game
2. **Create scope template** for next update
3. **Set and enforce lock dates**
4. **Conduct post-mortem** on last update
5. **Track scope discipline metrics**

# 5B.6 Event Complexity Management

## Why It Matters

Events are the heartbeat of live ops—and the most common source of complexity creep. Each event gets slightly more elaborate than the last. Special mechanics become expected. Unique rewards multiply. Managing event complexity means preserving the ability to run events sustainably without burning out the team or overwhelming players.

## Framework: Event Complexity Tiers

| Tier | Complexity | Frequency | Team Effort | Examples |
|------|------------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Tier 1: Simple** | Low | High | 1-2 days | Rerun, template event |
| **Tier 2: Standard** | Medium | Medium | 3-5 days | Seasonal, themed |
| **Tier 3: Premium** | High | Low | 1-2 weeks | Anniversary, major |
| **Tier 4: Tentpole** | Very high | Rare | 3-4 weeks | Launch celebration |

## Framework: Event Complexity Scorecard

| Factor | Score 1-5 | Your Event |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Unique mechanics | 1=none, 5=multiple | |
| New art assets | 1=none, 5=extensive | |
| Config complexity | 1=template, 5=custom | |
| Testing required | 1=minimal, 5=extensive | |
| Cross-team coordination | 1=none, 5=many teams | |
| Player communication | 1=standard, 5=special campaign | |
| **TOTAL** | Max 30 | |

**Tier assignment:**
- 6-10: Tier 1
- 11-16: Tier 2
- 17-22: Tier 3
- 23-30: Tier 4

## Framework: Complexity Budget

| Month | Tier 1 Budget | Tier 2 Budget | Tier 3+ Budget | Total |
|-------|---------------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Jan | | | | |
| Feb | | | | |
| Mar | | | | |
| ... | | | | |
| **Annual** | | | | |

**Rule:** Cannot exceed monthly complexity budget without trade-off.

## Framework: Simplification Techniques

| Technique | Application | Effort Saved |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Template reuse** | Same structure, new theme | 50-70% |
| **Art recycling** | Recolor, reskin | 60-80% |
| **Mechanic library** | Pre-built event types | 40-60% |
| **Config templates** | Pre-defined reward curves | 30-50% |
| **Automated testing** | Regression prevention | 20-30% |

## Diagnostic Questions

| Question | Answer | Implication |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| What was our simplest event last quarter? | | Complexity floor |
| What was our most complex? | | Complexity ceiling |
| Is the trend toward simple or complex? | | Direction of travel |
| What "one-time" mechanics became standard? | | Creep identified |
| What could we cut that players wouldn't miss? | | Over-engineering |

## Framework: Event Complexity Reset

When events have crept too complex:

| Step | Action | Timeline |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Audit last 10 events for complexity | Week 1 |
| 2 | Define new tier limits | Week 2 |
| 3 | Create simplified templates | Week 3-4 |
| 4 | Ship a deliberately simple event | Week 5-6 |
| 5 | Measure player response | Week 7-8 |
| 6 | Adjust and standardize | Ongoing |

## Checklist

- [ ] Complexity tiers defined
- [ ] Events scored consistently
- [ ] Complexity budget set
- [ ] Simplification techniques applied
- [ ] Templates created
- [ ] Trend monitored

# 5B.7 Tool Investment Decision Framework

## Why It Matters

Live ops teams often run at 110% capacity using 50% of the tools they need. Tool investment is always "next quarter" while the team burns out. A framework for tool investment decisions ensures you're making rational choices about automation, efficiency, and technical debt—not just perpetually deferring.

## Framework: Tool ROI Calculator

| Tool/Improvement | Build Cost (hours) | Time Saved (hours/month) | Payback Period | Priority |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------|----------|
| | | | months | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

**ROI Formula:** Payback Period = Build Cost ÷ Monthly Time Saved

## Framework: Tool Debt Assessment

| Process | Current Pain Level | Manual Hours/Month | Tool Exists? | Build/Buy/Accept |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|
| Event config | 1-5 | | Y/N | |
| Content deployment | | | | |
| QA automation | | | | |
| Analytics setup | | | | |
| Offer creation | | | | |
| Player support | | | | |

# 5B.10 Update Lock Discipline

## Why It Matters

Live games ship updates frequently, sometimes weekly. Without strict lock discipline, every update becomes a moving target, causing thrash, bugs, and burnout. Update lock for live games must be shorter, faster, and more rigorously enforced than pre-launch scope lock.

## Framework: Update Lock Timeline

| Update Type | Lock Before Release | Content Freeze | Final Review |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| Hotfix | Same day | N/A | 1 hour before |
| Patch | 2 days | 1 day | Half-day |
| Minor update | 5 days | 3 days | 1 day |
| Major update | 10 days | 7 days | 3 days |

## Framework: Lock Enforcement Playbook

| Stage | What's Locked | Allowed Changes | Authority |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Pre-lock** | Nothing | All changes | Normal process |
| **Soft lock** | Feature list | Bug fixes, minor adjustments | Team lead |
| **Hard lock** | Content and features | Critical bugs only | Producer |
| **Final lock** | Everything | Emergency only | Director |

## Framework: Lock Violation Tracking

| Date | Update | Violation | Requester | Impact | Outcome |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| | | | | | Approved/Denied |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |

**Monthly violation rate:** _______________

**Target:** <10% of updates have lock violations

## Framework: Lock Exception Process (Rapid)

For live game updates, the exception process must be fast:

| Step | Time | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | 5 min | Request filed with impact |
| 2 | 15 min | Engineering impact assessment |
| 3 | 15 min | QA impact assessment |
| 4 | 5 min | Decision by authority |
| **Total** | <45 min | From request to decision |

## Diagnostic Questions

| Question | Answer | Implication |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| How often do we violate lock? | | Discipline |
| What causes most violations? | | Prevention target |
| Are violations justified after the fact? | | Process accuracy |
| Do violations correlate with bugs? | | Quality impact |

## Framework: Update Ship Readiness

Before unlocking for release:

| Check | Status | Sign-off |
|-------|--------|----------|
| All planned work complete | ☐ | |

# 5B.11 Technical Debt vs. Feature Investment

## Why It Matters

Live games accumulate technical debt faster than pre-launch projects—every hotfix, every workaround, every "we'll fix it later" adds up. But paying down debt means not shipping features. Finding the right balance between debt payment and feature investment determines long-term game health.

## Framework: Technical Debt Inventory

| Debt Item | Category | Impact | Cost to Fix | Risk if Not Fixed |
|-----------|----------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| | Code/Tool/Process | High/Med/Low | hours | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

**Total debt:** _______________ hours

## Framework: Debt Priority Scoring

| Factor | Weight | Score 1-5 |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Slows daily operations | 30% | |
| Creates bugs/incidents | 25% | |
| Blocks future features | 20% | |
| Causes team frustration | 15% | |
| Has been promised before | 10% | |
| **WEIGHTED SCORE** | | /5 |

## Framework: Investment Ratio

| Allocation | Current | Target | Gap |
|------------|---------|--------|-----|
| Live content | % | % | |
| New features | % | % | |
| Bug fixes | % | % | |
| Tech debt | % | % | |
| Tools | % | % | |
| **TOTAL** | 100% | 100% | |

**Healthy tech debt allocation:** 15-25% of capacity

## Framework: Debt Payment Schedule

| Quarter | Debt Focus | Effort | Expected Improvement |
|---------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Q1 | | hours | |
| Q2 | | | |
| Q3 | | | |
| Q4 | | | |

## Diagnostic Questions

| Question | Answer | Implication |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| What debt causes the most daily pain? | | Priority target |
| What debt has existed longest? | | Normalized problems |
| What debt blocks future plans? | | Strategic debt |
| When did we last pay debt? | | Investment pattern |
| Is debt growing or shrinking? | | Trajectory |

## Framework: Debt vs. Feature Decision

When choosing between debt payment and features:

| Consider | Debt Payment Wins | Feature Wins |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Timeline** | No deadline pressure | Deadline-driven |
| **Revenue** | Current revenue at risk | Future revenue opportunity |
| **Team health** | Burnout risk high | Team capacity OK |
| **Incidents** | Debt causing outages | Stable operations |
| **Competition** | Not feature-competitive | Feature gap exists |

## Framework: Debt Communication

| Audience | Message |
|----------|---------|
| Leadership | "We need X% capacity for debt to maintain Y" |
| Stakeholders | "Debt payment enables faster feature delivery later" |
| Team | "We're investing in ourselves this sprint" |
| Finance | "Debt payment prevents $X in future costs" |

## Checklist

- [ ] Debt inventory maintained
- [ ] Debt priorities scored
- [ ] Investment ratio defined
- [ ] Payment schedule created
- [ ] Decision framework documented
- [ ] Communication approach ready

## Tasks

1. **Audit technical debt**

# 5B.12 Change Freeze Periods

## Why It Matters

Some periods require stability—holiday revenue peaks, major marketing pushes, certification windows. Change freeze periods protect revenue and player experience by minimizing risk during critical times. Knowing when to freeze and enforcing it requires planning and discipline.

## Framework: Annual Freeze Calendar

| Period | Type | Duration | Freeze Level | Reason |
|--------|------|----------|--------------|--------|
| Holiday (Dec-Jan) | Revenue protection | 3-4 weeks | Hard | Peak spending |
| Major sale events | Revenue protection | 1 week each | Medium | Sale stability |
| Certification windows | Technical | As needed | Hard | Compliance |
| Marketing tentpoles | Coordination | 1-2 weeks | Soft | Campaign stability |

## Framework: Freeze Levels

| Level | Definition | Allowed Changes | Authority |
|-------|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Soft Freeze** | Caution period | Low-risk changes, bug fixes | Team lead |
| **Medium Freeze** | Restricted changes | Bug fixes, critical config | Producer |
| **Hard Freeze** | Emergency only | Critical fixes only | Director |
| **Total Freeze** | No changes | Zero changes | VP |

## Framework: Pre-Freeze Preparation

| Timing | Action |
|--------|--------|
| T-4 weeks | Announce freeze dates |
| T-2 weeks | Complete feature work |

# 5B.13 Seasonal and Event Planning Discipline

## Why It Matters

Live games run on calendars—holidays, seasons, cultural events. Without planning discipline, each seasonal period requires heroic effort. Planning discipline means knowing what's coming, preparing in advance, and having capacity to execute without crunch.

## Framework: Annual Calendar Template

| Month | Season/Holiday | Event Type | Complexity | Prep Start |
|-------|----------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Jan | New Year | Tier 2 | Medium | Nov |
| Feb | Valentine's | | | |
| Mar | Spring | | | |
| Apr | Easter/Spring | | | |
| May | | | | |
| Jun | Summer | | | |
| Jul | | | | |
| Aug | Back to School | | | |
| Sep | Fall | | | |
| Oct | Halloween | | | |
| Nov | Thanksgiving | | | |
| Dec | Winter/Holiday | | | |

## Framework: Event Planning Timeline

| Milestone | Timing | Deliverable |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Concept | T-12 weeks | Theme, goals, high-level design |
| Design lock | T-8 weeks | Full design document |
| Art start | T-8 weeks | Asset list, briefs |
| Config start | T-6 weeks | Reward curves, economy |
| QA start | T-4 weeks | Test plan, staging |
| Content lock | T-2 weeks | Final assets, config |
| Deploy | T-3 days | Staged rollout |
| Go live | T-0 | Event active |

## Framework: Capacity Planning

| Month | Content Work | Event Work | Feature Work | Slack |
|-------|--------------|------------|--------------|-------|
| | % | % | % | % |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

**Rule:** Maintain minimum 10-15% slack for unexpected work

## Framework: Event Retrospective Questions

After each seasonal event:

| Question | Answer | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Did we hit timeline? | | |
| Did we hit quality targets? | | |
| What took longer than expected? | | |
| What should we prep earlier next time? | | |
| What can we template for next year? | | |

## Framework: Multi-Year Learning

| Event | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Trend |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Halloween | Notes | Notes | Notes | Improving/Static/Declining |
| Winter Holiday | | | | |
| Summer Event | | | | |

## Diagnostic Questions

| Question | Answer | Implication |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| How many times did we crunch for events? | | Planning gaps |
| Which events have reusable templates? | | Efficiency opportunity |
| What's our event lead time? | | Planning horizon |
| Do we retrospect on every event? | | Learning culture |

## Checklist

# 5B.14 Long-Term Roadmap Governance

## Why It Matters

Live games need a long-term vision, but that vision must balance flexibility with commitment. Too rigid and you can't respond to data or market changes. Too flexible and you can't plan, hire, or make promises. Roadmap governance provides the structure to maintain direction while allowing appropriate adaptation.

## Framework: Roadmap Layers

## Block 5 Summary

You've now completed Block 5: Scope & Change Management. Whether you're building something new or running a live game, you have frameworks for:

**For Greenfield Projects (Track A):**
- Detecting and preventing scope creep
- Processing feature requests fairly
- Assessing change impact thoroughly
- Making cut/keep/defer decisions systematically
- Defining minimum viable scope
- Managing stakeholder expectations
- Enforcing scope lock discipline

**For Mature Games (Track B):**
- Auditing and resetting accumulated complexity
- Maintaining sustainable content velocity
- Managing live game change impact
- Balancing tool investment with feature work
- Enforcing update discipline
- Planning seasonal content without crunch
- Governing long-term roadmap health

**Key Principle:** Scope management isn't about saying no—it's about saying yes to the right things at the right time. Every addition has a cost. Every deferral is a choice. Make those choices explicitly, document them well, and communicate them clearly.
