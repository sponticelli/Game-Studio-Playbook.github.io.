# HOW TO USE THIS WORKBOOK

## Building Your Game Studio Playbook

> _"Process is what happens when you stop having to think about how you do things. A good process is invisible—it just makes the work flow."_

# Why This Workbook Exists

## The Problem with Game Development Knowledge

Game development knowledge lives in three unreliable places: the heads of experienced people who eventually leave, scattered documents that fall out of date, and tribal knowledge passed down through inconsistent mentorship. When projects fail, teams often discover they skipped foundational work. When projects succeed, they struggle to replicate what worked.

This workbook exists to externalize the thinking that experienced game developers carry implicitly. It captures the questions you should ask, the frameworks that structure good decisions, and the checklists that prevent common failures—not as theory, but as practical tools you can deploy immediately.

## What This Workbook Is (and Isn't)

**This workbook IS:**

- A collection of frameworks, checklists, and templates you can adapt
- A diagnostic tool for identifying gaps in your current process
- A training resource for developing team members
- A starting point for your studio's customized playbook
- Technology and genre agnostic—the principles apply broadly

**This workbook is NOT:**

- A rigid prescription that must be followed exactly
- A replacement for experienced judgment
- Complete—no methodology covers every situation
- The only way to make games successfully

The goal is not to follow this workbook slavishly. The goal is to use it as raw material to build something better: a playbook customized to your team, your game, and your context.

# How This Workbook Is Organized

## The Seven Blocks

The workbook is organized into seven blocks, each addressing a critical domain of game development:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│  BLOCK 4: DAILY PRODUCTION                                          │
│  Definition of done, task management, build stability               │
│  ↓                                                                  │
│  BLOCK 5: SCOPE MANAGEMENT                                          │
│  Change control, feature triage, stakeholder management             │
│  ↓                                                                  │
│  BLOCK 6: RISK & PROBLEM SOLVING                                    │
│  Risk registers, incident response, retrospectives                  │
│  ↓                                                                  │
│  BLOCK 7: LAUNCH & LIVE OPS                                         │
│  Store optimization, event design, growth, sustainability           │
│                                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The blocks build on each other. Foundation work (Block 1) informs planning (Block 2). Team structure (Block 3) enables daily production (Block 4). Scope management (Block 5) and risk handling (Block 6) keep you on track. Launch and live ops (Block 7) bring it all together for the market.

## The Dual-Track System

Not every team starts from zero. This workbook recognizes two distinct starting points:

### Track A: Greenfield Development

For teams building **new games from scratch**:

- No legacy code or content to work around
- Opportunity to establish processes from the beginning
- Focus on foundational decisions that are hard to change later
- Primary blocks: 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A, 7A

### Track B: Mature Games & Live Operations

For teams working on **games that have been live for 1+ years**:

- Existing codebase, content, and technical debt
- Historical data available for analysis
- Focus on audit, optimization, and realignment
- May have inherited the project or experienced significant team turnover
- Primary blocks: 1B, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B, 6B, 7B

```

**When to use Track B instead of Track A:**

- Game has been live for 1+ years
- You have meaningful historical data to analyze
- The team inherited the project or has significant turnover
- You're questioning whether the current direction is right
- Maintenance burden is crowding out new development
- Metrics are declining or plateauing
- You're considering a major update, pivot, or sunset

**Many teams will use both tracks.** A live game launching a major new feature might use Track B to audit current state and Track A to plan the new initiative.

# Anatomy of a Topic

Each topic in this workbook follows a consistent structure designed for practical application:

## 1. Why It Matters

Context for why this topic deserves attention. What goes wrong when you skip it. What becomes possible when you do it well. This section helps you decide whether to invest time here or move on.

## 2. Frameworks

Structured approaches to the topic. These might include:

- **Visual diagrams** showing relationships and flows
- **Decision matrices** for making choices
- **Templates** you can fill in directly
- **Scoring systems** for prioritization

Frameworks are tools, not rules. Adapt them to your context.

## 3. Checklists

Binary verification items. Either you've done them or you haven't. Checklists prevent the most common oversights and create accountability. They're designed to be:

- Actionable (clear what "done" means)
- Comprehensive (cover the important items)
- Practical (not bureaucratic box-checking)

## 4. Tasks

Concrete exercises to complete. Tasks turn passive reading into active application. They're sequenced to build on each other and often include time estimates.

## 5. Diagnostic Questions (Track B)

For mature games, diagnostic questions help surface hidden problems. They're designed to provoke honest assessment, not comfortable answers.

## 6. Notes Section

Space for your project-specific decisions, customizations, and observations. This is where generic frameworks become your team's specific practices.

# How to Work Through This Workbook

## Approach 1: Sequential Foundation

For teams starting fresh or establishing process for the first time:

```
Week 1-2:  Block 1 (Foundation) — Vision, business model, audience
Week 3-4:  Block 2 (Planning) — Milestones, prioritization, estimation
Week 5-6:  Block 3 (Team) — Roles, communication, knowledge management
Week 7-8:  Block 4 (Production) — Daily execution, quality gates
Week 9-10: Block 5 (Scope) — Change management, stakeholder alignment
Week 11-12: Block 6 (Risk) — Risk register, incident response
Week 13+:  Block 7 (Launch) — As you approach release
```

**Pace yourself.** Better to complete one block thoroughly than rush through all seven superficially. The frameworks need time to sink in and get customized.

## Approach 2: Targeted Intervention

For teams with specific pain points:

|If your problem is...|Start with...|
|---|---|
|"We don't know what we're building"|Block 1: Foundation|
|"We can't estimate or hit dates"|Block 2: Planning|
|"Communication is broken"|Block 3: Team Structure|
|"Quality keeps slipping"|Block 4: Daily Production|
|"Scope keeps expanding"|Block 5: Scope Management|
|"We're constantly firefighting"|Block 6: Risk & Problem Solving|
|"Our live ops is chaotic"|Block 7: Launch & Live Ops|

**Solve the urgent problem first.** You can circle back to foundational blocks once the immediate crisis is handled.

## Approach 3: Health Check

For mature teams wanting to assess their current state:

1. **Skim all Block headers** to see what's covered
2. **For each topic**, ask: "Do we have this? Is it working?"
3. **Flag gaps** — topics where you have nothing or what you have isn't working
4. **Prioritize gaps** — which missing pieces are causing the most pain?
5. **Work through prioritized topics** in detail

This approach treats the workbook as a diagnostic tool rather than a curriculum.

# Creating Your Game Studio Playbook

The ultimate goal is not to follow this workbook but to build your own **Studio Playbook**—a living document customized to your team, your games, and your way of working.

## What Is a Studio Playbook?

A playbook is your team's operating manual. It captures:

- **How you work** (processes, rituals, communication norms)
- **How you make decisions** (who decides what, escalation paths)
- **What quality means** (definitions of done, standards)
- **What you've learned** (retrospective insights, post-mortems)

Unlike this workbook, your playbook is specific to your context. It uses your terminology, reflects your tools, and evolves with your team.

## The Playbook Creation Process

### Phase 1: Audit (Weeks 1-2)

Before creating anything new, understand what you already have.

**Step 1: Gather existing documentation**

- Design documents, tech specs, post-mortems
- Onboarding materials
- Meeting agendas and notes
- Informal "how we do things" guides

**Step 2: Interview key team members**

- What processes exist (formally or informally)?
- What works well?
- What causes the most friction?
- What do new team members struggle with?

**Step 3: Map against workbook topics**

|Block|Topic|We Have|Quality|Gap?|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Vision Statement|✓|Good|No|
|1|Business Model|✓|Outdated|Yes|
|2|Milestone Definitions|✗|N/A|Yes|
|3|RACI Matrix|Partial|Incomplete|Yes|
|...|...|...|...|...|

### Phase 2: Prioritize (Week 3)

You can't fix everything at once. Prioritize gaps based on:

**Impact:** How much pain is this causing?

- High: Blocking work, causing failures, burning people out
- Medium: Creating friction, slowing things down
- Low: Suboptimal but manageable

**Effort:** How hard is this to fix?

- Low: Can implement in a day
- Medium: Requires a week of focused work
- High: Needs significant investment, coordination, or culture change

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Select your first 3-5 topics to address.** Resist the urge to do everything.

### Phase 3: Customize (Weeks 4-8)

For each prioritized topic, work through the workbook material and adapt it to your context.

**Step 1: Complete the workbook topic**

- Read "Why It Matters" for context
- Work through the frameworks
- Complete the checklists (honestly)
- Do the tasks

**Step 2: Adapt to your context**

- What terminology fits your team?
- What tools do you use?
- What scale are you operating at?
- What constraints do you have?

**Step 3: Write your playbook version**

- Keep it concise (one page per topic is ideal)
- Use your team's language
- Include specific examples from your project
- Make it actionable

**Step 4: Validate with the team**

- Share drafts for feedback
- Test processes in practice
- Iterate based on what works

### Phase 4: Implement (Ongoing)

Documentation without adoption is waste.

**Introduce gradually.** Don't dump 50 pages of new process on your team at once. Introduce one or two practices at a time. Let them become habit before adding more.

**Model the behavior.** Leaders should use the playbook visibly. If the producer asks "what does our Definition of Done say?" rather than just shipping, others will follow.

**Reference continuously.** When decisions come up, refer back to the playbook. "Our milestone definition says we need X before moving to Alpha."

**Update regularly.** The playbook is a living document. Schedule quarterly reviews to update what's not working.

## Playbook Maintenance Rhythm

A stale playbook is worse than no playbook—it teaches people to ignore documentation.

|Frequency|Activity|
|---|---|
|**Weekly**|Note what's not working (but don't fix yet)|
|**Monthly**|Review notes, make minor updates|
|**Quarterly**|Deep review of one section, validate with team|
|**Per milestone**|Update project-specific content|
|**Per retrospective**|Capture process learnings|
|**Per incident**|Update response procedures|

**Assign ownership.** Every playbook section needs an owner responsible for keeping it current. This doesn't mean they write everything—they ensure it stays accurate.

# Making It Stick

## Common Failure Modes

**Failure 1: Documentation without adoption** You create beautiful playbook pages that no one reads or follows. _Fix: Start small. Implement one practice until it's habit before adding another._

**Failure 2: Process for process's sake** Every workflow gets a checklist, every meeting gets a template, every decision needs a framework. _Fix: Only document what causes real problems. If something works informally, leave it alone._

**Failure 3: Rigidity over judgment** The playbook becomes a rule book. People follow it mechanically even when it doesn't apply. _Fix: Teach principles, not just procedures. The playbook is guidance, not law._

**Failure 4: Leaders don't use it** The playbook is "for the team" while leads operate on intuition and exceptions. _Fix: Leadership must model playbook usage. If it's not good enough for you, fix it or drop it._

**Failure 5: Never updating** The playbook reflects how you worked two years ago, not how you work now. _Fix: Schedule regular reviews. Treat the playbook as a product with its own roadmap._

## Signs Your Playbook Is Working

- New team members become productive faster
- Recurring problems stop recurring
- Meetings end with clear outcomes
- Decisions reference documented principles
- Post-mortems identify process gaps that get fixed
- Team members contribute improvements voluntarily
- Less time spent on "how do we do this?" discussions

## Signs Your Playbook Needs Work

- People don't know it exists
- People know it exists but don't use it
- Following it creates more friction than it solves
- It contradicts how work actually happens
- Only one person understands or maintains it
- It hasn't been updated in six months

# Quick Start Guide

If you've read this far and want to start immediately, here's your first week:

## Day 1: Assess

- [ ] Determine your track (A: Greenfield or B: Mature Game)
- [ ] Identify your biggest current pain point
- [ ] Find the corresponding workbook block

## Days 2-3: Learn

- [ ] Read through the relevant block introduction
- [ ] Complete one topic that addresses your pain point
- [ ] Take notes on what applies to your situation

## Days 4-5: Adapt

- [ ] Write a one-page version in your team's language
- [ ] Share with 2-3 trusted colleagues for feedback
- [ ] Revise based on their input

## End of Week 1

- [ ] Introduce the practice to your team
- [ ] Agree to try it for two weeks
- [ ] Schedule a check-in to assess

**Then repeat.** One practice at a time, building toward a comprehensive playbook.

# Final Thoughts

The best game development process is the one your team actually follows. This workbook provides frameworks, but frameworks don't ship games—people do. The goal is to remove friction, surface problems early, and let talented people do their best work.

Use this workbook as a toolbox, not a textbook. Take what works, adapt what's close, and ignore what doesn't fit. The measure of success isn't workbook completion—it's whether your team ships better games with less pain.

Good luck.
