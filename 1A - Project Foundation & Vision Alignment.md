# 1.1 One-Page Vision Statement

## Why It Matters

Without a written vision, every team member carries a different game in their head. Decisions become debates about personal preference rather than alignment checks against a shared north star. A one-page vision document forces clarity and becomes the tiebreaker for every scope discussion.

## Framework: The Vision Diamond

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                 │   CORE FANTASY  │
	            │  What feeling?  │
                       └────────┬────────┘
                             │

                    │ What do you do? │
                    └─────────────────┘
```

# 1.2 Business Model Selection

## Why It Matters

Your business model isn't a post-production decision—it fundamentally shapes game design, economy, session structure, and team composition. A F2P game needs live ops infrastructure, analytics pipelines, and monetization touchpoints designed from day one. A premium game needs enough content depth to justify the price. Choosing wrong means rebuilding core systems.

## Framework: Business Model Decision Matrix

| Factor | Premium | Free-to-Play | Hybrid (Premium + IAP) |
|--------|---------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Revenue timing** | Upfront, front-loaded | Ongoing, back-loaded | Split |
| **Content depth required** | High (justifies price) | Expandable over time | Moderate + expandable |
| **Live ops requirement** | Optional | Mandatory | Recommended |
| **Analytics dependency** | Low | Critical | Moderate |
| **Team size (sustain)** | Minimal post-launch | Ongoing team required | Small ongoing team |
| **Player expectation** | Complete experience | Ongoing updates | Complete + extras |
| **Monetization design** | N/A | Core to gameplay | Additive, not core |
| **UA strategy** | Launch spike + long tail | Continuous spend | Launch + moderate ongoing |

## Business Model Implications Checklist

### If Premium:
- [ ] Game has 4+ hours of core content minimum
- [ ] No pay-to-win mechanics (players paid for the full experience)
- [ ] Price point validated against genre benchmarks
- [ ] Platform fees factored into margin (30% on most stores)
- [ ] Demo or trailer clearly communicates value

### If Free-to-Play:
- [ ] Core loop is fun WITHOUT spending money
- [ ] Monetization touchpoints identified in game flow
- [ ] Soft currency and hard currency economies designed
- [ ] Live ops calendar roughed out for Year 1
- [ ] Analytics SDK and event tracking planned
- [ ] Remote config system in technical requirements
- [ ] A/B testing infrastructure planned
- [ ] Player segmentation strategy outlined

### If Hybrid:
- [ ] Base game is complete and satisfying
- [ ] IAP adds value without creating "pay to complete" feeling
- [ ] Clear communication about what's included vs. extra

## Framework: Monetization Touchpoint Mapping

For F2P and Hybrid models, map where monetization intersects with player motivation:

| Player Motivation | Monetization Opportunity | Example |
|-------------------|-------------------------|---------|
| **Progress faster** | Time skips, boosters | "Finish now" for gems |
| **Express identity** | Cosmetics, customization | Skins, avatars |
| **Compete better** | Power (use carefully) | Better gear, characters |
| **Access more content** | Unlocks, expansions | New levels, modes |
| **Remove friction** | Ad removal, QoL | No ads, extra inventory |
| **Support the game** | Tip jar, patron items | Founder's pack |

## Tasks

1. **Select your primary model.** Circle one: `PREMIUM` / `F2P` / `HYBRID`
2. **List 3 games in your genre using the same model.** Study their implementation.
3. **If F2P: Map 5 monetization touchpoints** in your core loop using the table above.
4. **Calculate minimum viable revenue** needed to sustain development post-launch.

## Your Business Model Decision

**Selected Model:** _______________

**Rationale (why this model fits your game, team, and goals):**

# 1.3 Target Audience Definition

## Why It Matters

"Everyone" is not an audience. Trying to please everyone results in a game that delights no one. Specific audience definition drives marketing messaging, feature prioritization, difficulty tuning, art style choices, and platform selection. You can expand later—but you need a beachhead.

## Framework: Player Persona Template

Create 1-2 primary personas. Be specific enough that you could find this person in real life.

### Persona 1: _______________

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Age range** | |
| **Platform** | Mobile / PC / Console / Multi |
| **Play session length** | |
| **Play frequency** | Daily / Several times a week / Weekends |
| **Spending behavior** | Non-spender / Minnow / Dolphin / Whale |
| **Current games they play** | |
| **What they're looking for** | |
| **What frustrates them** | |
| **Where they discover games** | |
| **Social play preference** | Solo / Co-op / Competitive / Social-adjacent |

### Why would this person choose YOUR game over alternatives?

```
_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________
```

### Persona 2 (if applicable): _______________

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Age range** | |
| **Platform** | Mobile / PC / Console / Multi |
| **Play session length** | |
| **Play frequency** | Daily / Several times a week / Weekends |
| **Spending behavior** | Non-spender / Minnow / Dolphin / Whale |
| **Current games they play** | |
| **What they're looking for** | |
| **What frustrates them** | |
| **Where they discover games** | |
| **Social play preference** | Solo / Co-op / Competitive / Social-adjacent |

## Framework: Audience Validation Questions

Answer these to pressure-test your audience definition:

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| Where do these players hang out online? | |
| What YouTubers/streamers do they watch? | |
| What subreddits or Discord servers are they in? | |
| What's the size of this audience (estimate)? | |
| Are they underserved or oversaturated? | |
| Can you reach them affordably? | |

## Checklist

- [ ] Persona is specific enough to be a real person
- [ ] You can name 3 existing games your persona plays
- [ ] You know where to find this audience online
- [ ] The audience is large enough to sustain your business model
- [ ] The audience is reachable with your marketing budget
- [ ] Team members agree on who the primary audience is

## Tasks

1. **Find 5 real people** who match your persona. Talk to them about their gaming habits.
2. **Join 2-3 communities** where your target audience discusses games.
3. **Study the top 5 games** your persona plays. What do they have in common?
4. **Write your persona on an index card.** Keep it visible during design decisions.

# 1.4 Success Metrics Framework

## Why It Matters

"Success" means different things to different stakeholders. Without explicit metrics, you can't evaluate soft launch data, make kill decisions, or know if live ops is working. Define success BEFORE you have data—otherwise you'll rationalize whatever numbers you get.

## Framework: Metric Tiers

### Tier 1: Survival Metrics (Must Hit)
*If these fail, the project is not viable.*

| Metric | Your Target | Industry Benchmark | Kill Threshold |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| D1 Retention | | 40%+ (casual), 30%+ (mid-core) | |
| D7 Retention | | 20%+ (casual), 15%+ (mid-core) | |
| D30 Retention | | 10%+ (casual), 7%+ (mid-core) | |
| Tutorial Completion | | 75%+ | |
| Crash Rate | | <1% | |
| LTV > CPI | | Positive unit economics | |

### Tier 2: Health Metrics (Should Hit)
*These indicate a good game that can grow.*

| Metric | Your Target | Industry Benchmark |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Session Length | | Genre-dependent |
| Sessions per Day | | Genre-dependent |
| D7 ARPU | | Genre-dependent |
| Payer Conversion | | 2-5% (F2P) |
| Viral Coefficient | | 0.1+ organic |
| App Store Rating | | 4.0+ |

### Tier 3: Growth Metrics (Nice to Hit)
*These indicate a hit that can scale.*

| Metric | Your Target | Aspirational Benchmark |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| D30 ROAS | | 100%+ |
| Organic Install % | | 30%+ |
| Feature Rate | | Achieved |
| Community Size | | Growing week-over-week |

## Framework: The Kill Decision Matrix

Pre-commit to your kill criteria. This is the hardest decision to make in the moment—make it now while you're objective.

| Scenario | Data Signal | Decision |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Core loop isn't fun | D1 < 25%, qualitative feedback negative | Kill or major pivot |
| Retention fixable | D1 okay, D7 weak, clear FTUE issues | Iterate on onboarding |
| Monetization weak | Retention good, ARPU low | Iterate on economy |
| UA too expensive | Good metrics, CPI > LTV | Explore organic, niche down |
| Everything weak | All metrics below threshold | Kill project |

**Our kill threshold:** If _______________ after _______________ weeks of iteration, we will stop development.

## Checklist

- [ ] Survival metrics defined with specific numbers
- [ ] Kill threshold explicitly stated
- [ ] Team and stakeholders have agreed to kill criteria
- [ ] Benchmarks are genre-appropriate (not generic)
- [ ] Tracking infrastructure can measure these metrics
- [ ] Review cadence established (weekly during soft launch)

## Tasks

1. **Research 5 comparable games' metrics** (use Sensor Tower, Data.ai, or industry reports)
2. **Set your Tier 1 targets** with specific numbers—no ranges
3. **Write your kill criteria** and get stakeholder sign-off
4. **Verify your analytics SDK** can track all required metrics

# 1.5 Scope Boundaries Document

## Why It Matters

Scope creep kills more indie games than any other factor. Over 70% of failed indie projects cite "scope too large" as a primary factor. The solution isn't willpower—it's explicit documentation of what's in, what's out, and what's "maybe later."

## Framework: Scope Rings

```
        ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
        │                         RING 3: NEVER                        │
        │           Features explicitly out of scope forever           │
        │  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐  │
        │  │                    RING 2: POST-LAUNCH                 │  │
        │  │           Good ideas parked for after v1.0             │  │

        │  │  │         Must ship for v1.0 / soft launch         │  │  │
        │  │  │  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐  │  │  │
        │  │  │  │              RING 0: MVP                   │  │  │  │
        │  │  │  │     Minimum viable for core loop test      │  │  │  │
        │  │  │  └────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │  │  │

        └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Scope Definition Template

*What's the minimum needed to test if the core loop is fun?*

| Feature/System | Why Essential |
|---------------|---------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |

### Ring 1: Launch Scope
*What must ship in v1.0 to meet player expectations and business goals?*

| Feature/System | Why Essential |
|---------------|---------------|

### Ring 2: Post-Launch Parking Lot
*Good ideas that wait for updates, DLC, or sequels.*

| Feature/System | Why Deferred | Potential Timing |
|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

### Ring 3: Explicitly Out of Scope
*Ideas we've discussed and rejected. Writing them here prevents re-litigation.*

| Feature/System | Why Rejected |
|---------------|--------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |

## Framework: The Scope Lock Commitment

**Scope Lock Date:** _______________

After this date, no new features enter Ring 1 without:
1. Executive/lead approval
2. Documented trade-off (what gets cut or delayed)
3. Written justification tied to core metrics

**Exception process:** _______________________________________________

## Checklist

- [ ] Ring 0 (MVP) is small enough to build in ______ weeks
- [ ] Ring 1 (Launch) is achievable with current team in ______ months
- [ ] Every Ring 1 item ties to vision or success metrics
- [ ] Ring 2 items are genuinely deferrable (not "must-haves" in disguise)
- [ ] Ring 3 exists and has items in it (if empty, you haven't said "no" enough)
- [ ] Document is versioned and changes are tracked
- [ ] Team has reviewed and agreed

## Tasks

1. **List every feature idea** you've discussed for this project
2. **Categorize each into a Ring** using the criteria above
3. **Challenge Ring 1:** For each item, ask "Could we launch without this?"
4. **Set your scope lock date** and communicate it to all stakeholders

# 1.6 Core Loop Validation

## Why It Matters

No amount of polish, content, or marketing saves a game with a weak core loop. Validate early before you've invested in art, levels, and systems built on a flawed foundation. Many successful games (Stardew Valley, Vampire Survivors) prove that a tight core loop beats feature breadth.

## Framework: Core Loop Anatomy

```
       ┌─────────────┐
       │   GOAL      │  ← What is the player trying to achieve?
       └──────┬──────┘
              │
              ▼
       ┌─────────────┐
       │   ACTION    │  ← What does the player DO?
       └──────┬──────┘
              │
              ▼
       ┌─────────────┐
       │   FEEDBACK  │  ← How does the game respond?
       └──────┬──────┘
              │
              ▼
       ┌─────────────┐
       │   REWARD    │  ← What does the player gain?
       └──────┬──────┘
              │
              ▼
       ┌─────────────┐
       │  VARIATION  │  ← What changes to keep it fresh?
       └──────┬──────┘
              │
              └──────────► (back to GOAL)
```

## Core Loop Definition

### Primary Loop (Moment-to-Moment)
*What happens every few seconds?*

| Element | Your Game |
|---------|-----------|
| **Goal** | |
| **Action** | |
| **Feedback** | |
| **Reward** | |
| **Variation** | |

**Loop duration:** ______ seconds/minutes

### Secondary Loop (Session-Level)
*What happens across a play session?*

| Element | Your Game |
|---------|-----------|
| **Goal** | |
| **Action** | |
| **Feedback** | |
| **Reward** | |
| **Variation** | |

**Loop duration:** ______ minutes

### Tertiary Loop (Progression)
*What happens across sessions and days?*

| Element | Your Game |
|---------|-----------|
| **Goal** | |
| **Action** | |
| **Feedback** | |
| **Reward** | |
| **Variation** | |

**Loop duration:** ______ sessions/days

## Framework: Core Loop Validation Criteria

Test your core loop against these questions:

| Question | Answer | Score (1-5) |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Is the core action inherently satisfying? | | |
| Is feedback immediate and clear? | | |
| Does the player feel agency? | | |
| Is there meaningful decision-making? | | |
| Does variation prevent monotony? | | |
| Can you play for 30+ minutes without new content? | | |
| Do playtesters want "one more round"? | | |
| **Total Score** | | /35 |

**Target:** 28+ before investing in full production

## Framework: Paper Prototype Test

Before building digitally, test your core loop:

1. **Create a paper/tabletop version** of your core mechanic
2. **Play 10 rounds** with yourself
3. **Play 5 sessions** with 3 different people
4. **Document observations:**

| Tester | Did they want to keep playing? | What confused them? | What delighted them? |
|--------|-------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |

## Checklist

- [ ] Core loop can be explained in under 30 seconds
- [ ] Core action is fun without progression systems
- [ ] Paper/prototype testing complete with external players
- [ ] "One more round" impulse observed in playtesters
- [ ] Loop aligns with target session length
- [ ] Monetization touchpoints (if F2P) integrate without breaking flow

## Tasks

1. **Diagram your core loop** using the anatomy framework
2. **Build the simplest possible prototype** (paper, spreadsheet, or minimal code)
3. **Run 5 playtest sessions** with people outside your team
4. **Identify the weakest element** of your loop and iterate before proceeding

# 1.7 Platform & Technical Constraints

## Why It Matters

Platform choice determines your audience, monetization options, technical requirements, and certification timelines. Technical constraints discovered mid-production cause costly rework. Map these early.

## Framework: Platform Decision Matrix

| Factor | Mobile (iOS/Android) | PC (Steam) | Console (Switch/PS/Xbox) |
|--------|---------------------|------------|--------------------------|
| **Audience size** | Largest | Large | Medium |
| **Monetization models** | F2P dominant, IAP, Ads | Premium dominant, some F2P | Premium dominant |
| **Discovery** | UA-dependent, ASO | Steam algorithm, wishlists | Platform featuring, limited |
| **Session expectations** | Short (3-10 min) | Long (30+ min) | Variable |
| **Input method** | Touch, simple | Keyboard/mouse, controller | Controller |
| **Certification** | App review (days) | None | Cert process (weeks) |
| **Dev kit cost** | Free | Free | Varies ($0-$2500+) |
| **Revenue share** | 30% (15% small business) | 30% (decreasing tiers) | 30% |
| **Update frequency** | Can be frequent | Can be frequent | Cert delays each update |

# 1.8 Live Ops Vision

## Why It Matters

For F2P games, launch is the beginning, not the end. 84% of mobile IAP revenue comes from games with live ops. But live ops requires infrastructure, tools, and team capacity planned from day one—not bolted on after launch.

## Framework: Live Ops Maturity Levels

| Level | Description | Infrastructure Needed | Team Capacity |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|---------------|
| **0 - None** | Ship and done | None | None post-launch |
| **1 - Maintenance** | Bug fixes, balance patches | Basic remote config | Part-time |
| **2 - Content Updates** | New levels, characters, items | Content pipeline, CMS | Small ongoing team |
| **3 - Events** | Time-limited events, promotions | Event system, scheduling | Dedicated live ops team |
| **4 - Personalization** | Segmented content, dynamic offers | Analytics, segmentation, A/B testing | Data + live ops team |

**Our target level:** _______________

## Live Ops Calendar Framework

### Event Cadence Planning

| Event Type | Frequency | Duration | Team Effort | Purpose |
|------------|-----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Major seasonal** | Quarterly | 2-4 weeks | High | Retention spike, revenue |
| **Minor themed** | Monthly | 1 week | Medium | Engagement |
| **Competitive** | Bi-weekly | 3-7 days | Medium | Competition, social |
| **Flash sale** | Weekly | 24-48 hours | Low | Revenue |
| **Daily challenge** | Daily | 24 hours | Minimal (automated) | Session driver |

### Year 1 Rough Calendar

| Quarter | Major Event | Minor Events | Content Updates |
|---------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Q1 | | | |
| Q2 | | | |
| Q3 | | | |
| Q4 | | | |

## Framework: Live Ops Infrastructure Requirements

| Capability | Required? | Solution | Build vs. Buy |
|------------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Remote config | | | |
| Feature flags | | | |
| A/B testing | | | |
| Event scheduling | | | |
| Offer management | | | |
| Push notifications | | | |
| Player segmentation | | | |
| Real-time analytics | | | |
| Economy monitoring | | | |
| Content management | | | |

## Content Velocity Planning

**Sustainable content output:** What can your team produce monthly post-launch?

| Content Type | Monthly Capacity | Production Time | Dependencies |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| New levels/stages | | | |
| New characters/items | | | |
| Event variants | | | |
| Balance updates | | | |
| Bug fixes | | | |

## Checklist

- [ ] Live ops maturity level selected
- [ ] Event cadence roughly planned for Year 1
- [ ] Infrastructure requirements documented
- [ ] Content velocity estimated based on team capacity

# 1.9 Team Capacity Audit

## Why It Matters

Ambition exceeds capacity on most failed projects. Honest assessment of what your team can actually deliver—accounting for skill gaps, availability, and sustainable pace—prevents death marches and abandoned projects.

## Framework: Team Capacity Matrix

| Role | Person | Hours/Week | Skill Level (1-5) | Gaps/Risks |
|------|--------|------------|-------------------|------------|
| Production | | | | |
| Game Design | | | | |
| Engineering | | | | |
| Art | | | | |
| Audio | | | | |
| QA | | | | |
| Marketing | | | | |
| Community | | | | |
| Analytics | | | | |

**Total productive hours/week:** _______________

## Framework: Capacity Calculation

### Step 1: Raw Hours
| Team Member | Hours/Week Committed | Realistic Productive Hours (70%) |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| **Total** | | |

### Step 2: Apply Reality Factors

| Factor | Multiplier |
|--------|------------|
| Part-time team | ×0.4-0.6 (context switching overhead) |
| Remote team | ×0.85-0.95 (communication overhead) |
| New to engine/tools | ×0.5-0.7 (learning curve) |
| Unclear requirements | ×0.6-0.8 (rework) |
| First project together | ×0.7-0.85 (coordination) |

**Adjusted weekly capacity:** _______________ hours

### Step 3: Phase Capacity Allocation

| Phase | Duration | Hours Available | Major Deliverables |
|-------|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Pre-production | | | |
| Prototype/MVP | | | |
| Production | | | |
| Polish | | | |
| Soft launch | | | |
| Launch | | | |

## Skill Gap Analysis

| Required Skill | Current Level | Required Level | Gap | Mitigation |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|-----|------------|
| | | | | Hire / Train / Outsource / Simplify |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

## Framework: Launch vs. Sustain Team

| Role | Launch Phase | Live Ops Phase | Notes |
|------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| Producer | | | |
| Designer | | | |
| Engineer | | | |
| Artist | | | |
| QA | | | |
| Community | | | |
| Live Ops | | | |

## Checklist

- [ ] Every team member's actual availability documented (not aspirational)
- [ ] Skill gaps identified with mitigation plans
- [ ] Scope aligned with realistic capacity
- [ ] Sustainable pace assumed (no planned crunch)
- [ ] Key person dependencies identified
- [ ] Launch vs. sustain team transition planned (if applicable)

## Tasks

1. **Interview each team member** about their realistic availability
2. **Apply reality multipliers** honestly—optimism kills projects
3. **Compare capacity to scope.** If scope > capacity, cut scope or extend timeline
4. **Identify your bus factor** (key people whose absence would halt the project)

# 1.10 Stakeholder Mapping

## Why It Matters

Unclear decision rights create bottlenecks, conflicts, and misaligned expectations. Know who owns what decisions, who needs to be consulted, and who just needs updates—before disagreements arise.

## Framework: RACI Matrix

**R** = Responsible (does the work)  
**A** = Accountable (makes final decision)  
**C** = Consulted (input before decision)  
**I** = Informed (told after decision)

| Decision Area | Person 1 | Person 2 | Person 3 | Person 4 |
|--------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Game vision/pillars | | | | |
| Feature scope | | | | |
| Art direction | | | | |
| Technical architecture | | | | |
| Economy/monetization | | | | |
| Live ops calendar | | | | |
| Pricing | | | | |
| Marketing messaging | | | | |

| Budget allocation | | | | |
| Hiring/team changes | | | | |
| Kill/pivot decision | | | | |

## Stakeholder Communication Plan

| Stakeholder | Interest/Concern | Update Frequency | Channel | Owner |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|---------|-------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

## Framework: Decision Escalation Tiers

| Decision Type | Who Decides | Escalation If Disagreement |
|---------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Day-to-day implementation | Individual contributor | Team lead |
| Feature design | Designer + Lead | Game Director |
| Technical approach | Engineer + Lead | Tech Lead |
| Scope changes | Product Owner | Stakeholder meeting |
| Budget impact | Project Lead | Executive/Founder |
| Kill/major pivot | _________________ | _________________ |

## Checklist

- [ ] Every major decision area has one Accountable person
- [ ] No decision has more than one "A"
- [ ] Key stakeholders know their role (R/A/C/I) for each area
- [ ] Communication cadence established
- [ ] Escalation path clear for disagreements
- [ ] External stakeholders (publisher, investors) mapped if applicable

## Tasks

1. **List all people with a stake** in the project's decisions
2. **Complete the RACI matrix** for the top 10 decision areas
3. **Review with each stakeholder** to confirm their understanding

# 1.12 Project Pillars Definition

## Why It Matters

Pillars are the 3-4 non-negotiable qualities that make your game YOUR game. They're the tiebreaker for every design debate and scope discussion. Features that don't serve at least one pillar should be questioned.

## Framework: Pillar Anatomy

A strong pillar is:
- **Specific to your game** (not generic like "fun" or "quality")
- **Actionable** (guides decisions)
- **Memorable** (team can recite from memory)
- **Limited** (3-4 maximum—more dilutes focus)

### Pillar Examples by Genre

| Genre | Example Pillars |
|-------|-----------------|
| Puzzle | "Aha moments every 30 seconds" / "No RNG, pure skill" / "Relaxing, not frustrating" |
| Roguelike | "Every run tells a story" / "Death teaches, never punishes" / "Broken builds are the goal" |
| Casual | "Playable with one thumb" / "3-minute sessions feel complete" / "Grandma can play" |
| Narrative | "Every choice has consequences" / "Characters feel like friends" / "No good endings, only true ones" |

## Your Project Pillars

### Pillar 1: _______________________________

**What it means:**
```
_______________________________________________________________________________
```

**Example decision it guides:**
```
_______________________________________________________________________________
```

**Feature that exemplifies this pillar:**
```

### Pillar 3: _______________________________

**What it means:**
```
_______________________________________________________________________________
```

**Example decision it guides:**
```
_______________________________________________________________________________
```

**Feature that exemplifies this pillar:**
```
_______________________________________________________________________________

### Pillar 4 (optional): _______________________________

**What it means:**
```
_______________________________________________________________________________
```

**Example decision it guides:**
```
_______________________________________________________________________________
```

**Feature that exemplifies this pillar:**
```
_______________________________________________________________________________
```

## Framework: Pillar Validation Questions

For each proposed feature or design decision, ask:

| Question | If Yes | If No |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Does this serve at least one pillar? | Proceed | Question necessity |
| Does this conflict with any pillar? | Reject or redesign | Proceed |
| If we had to cut this, would we lose a pillar? | Protect it | Consider cutting |

## Checklist

- [ ] 3-4 pillars defined (no more)
- [ ] Each pillar is specific to THIS game
- [ ] Pillars are memorable (team can recite them)
- [ ] Each pillar has example decisions it guides
- [ ] Pillars posted visibly in workspace
- [ ] Pillars referenced in design discussions

## Tasks

1. **Brainstorm 10 potential pillars** without filtering
2. **Combine and eliminate** down to 3-4
3. **Test each pillar** against a recent design decision—did it help?
4. **Create a poster/wallpaper** with your pillars for the team

# 1.13 Timeline Reality Check

## Why It Matters

Optimistic timelines set projects up for crunch, cut corners, or abandonment. Realistic timelines account for unknowns, iteration, and the fact that game development always takes longer than expected.

## Framework: Phase Duration Benchmarks

| Phase | Solo/Small Indie | Small Team (3-5) | Medium Team (6-15) |
|-------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Pre-production | 1-3 months | 2-4 months | 3-6 months |
| Prototype/MVP | 1-2 months | 1-3 months | 2-4 months |
| Production | 6-18 months | 6-24 months | 12-36 months |
| Polish | 1-3 months | 2-4 months | 3-6 months |
| Soft Launch (mobile) | 1-3 months | 2-4 months | 3-6 months |
| **Total Minimum** | 10-29 months | 13-39 months | 23-58 months |

Note: These are AVERAGES. First projects take longer. Novel mechanics take longer.

## Framework: Timeline Builder

### Your Project Timeline

| Phase | Planned Duration | Buffer (20%) | Dependencies | Exit Criteria |
|-------|------------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| Pre-production | | | | Vision, scope, team aligned |
| Prototype | | | | Core loop validated |
| Vertical Slice | | | | Fun confirmed, scope locked |
| Alpha | | | | All systems functional |
| Beta | | | | Feature complete, bug fixing |
| Soft Launch | | | | Metrics hit thresholds |
| Global Launch | | | | Go/no-go decision made |
| **Total** | | | | |

### Key Dates

| Milestone | Target Date | Hard Deadline? | What Slips If Missed |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

## Framework: Schedule Risk Factors

Apply multipliers for unknown/risky elements:

| Risk Factor | Multiplier | Applies to Your Project? |
|-------------|------------|--------------------------|
| New engine/tools | ×1.3-1.5 | |
| Novel mechanics | ×1.3-1.5 | |
| First project as a team | ×1.2-1.4 | |
| Part-time team | ×1.5-2.0 | |
| Unclear requirements | ×1.3-1.5 | |
| Dependent on external parties | ×1.2-1.4 | |
| Multiplayer/online | ×1.5-2.0 | |

**Aggregate multiplier:** _______________

**Adjusted timeline:** _______________

## Checklist

- [ ] Each phase has duration estimate AND exit criteria
- [ ] 20% buffer added to each phase
- [ ] Risk multipliers applied honestly
- [ ] Dependencies identified (what blocks what)
- [ ] Key dates are realistic, not aspirational
- [ ] Team agrees the timeline is achievable without sustained crunch
- [ ] Scope matches timeline (or one has been adjusted)

## Tasks

1. **Draft your timeline** using the benchmarks as starting points
2. **Apply risk multipliers** for your specific situation
3. **Identify the critical path** (the longest chain of dependencies)
4. **Pressure test:** Ask "What would make us miss this date?" for each milestone

# 1.14 Kickoff Alignment Workshop

## Why It Matters

Starting production without explicit alignment is starting with hidden disagreements. A kickoff workshop surfaces assumptions, builds shared understanding, and creates the foundation documents that guide the project.

## Framework: Kickoff Agenda Template

**Duration:** 2-4 hours (or split across sessions)

| Time | Activity | Output |
|------|----------|--------|
| 15 min | Context setting: Why are we here? What's at stake? | Shared motivation |
| 20 min | Vision review: Read and discuss vision statement | Confirmed vision alignment |
| 20 min | Pillars review: Discuss and refine project pillars | Finalized pillars |
| 30 min | Scope review: Walk through scope rings, discuss boundaries | Agreed scope boundaries |
| 20 min | Success metrics: Review targets and kill criteria | Committed metrics |
| 20 min | Timeline review: Walk through phases and key dates | Acknowledged timeline |
| 20 min | Roles and decisions: Review RACI and communication plan | Clear accountability |
| 15 min | Risks and concerns: Open floor for questions and worries | Documented concerns |
| 10 min | Commitments: What is each person committing to? | Public commitment |

## Framework: Alignment Confirmation

At the end of kickoff, each team member confirms:

### I understand and agree to:

| Item | ✓ |
|------|---|
| The vision statement | |
| The project pillars | |
| The scope boundaries (what's in, what's out) | |
| The success metrics and kill criteria | |
